At its most general, Top is a framework for constructing abstract interpretations 
which focuses on giving good feedback on why an abstract interpretation does not give 
any useful information. In a mathematical notation this is usually made explicit by 
returning the top element of a (complete) lattice. This is also one of the reasons 
for the name of the project.

We have obtained good results with our first subproject, delivering good type error messages
for a language quite similar to Haskell (a restricted implementation can be found in the
Helium compiler). For this reason, Top may also be read as Typing Our Programs. 
However, the approach that we used can also be deployed for other program analyses for which 
good feedback is desirable.
